# 🇫🇷 OnlyInFrance.com

A simple, crowdsourced feed of funny, weird, and charming things you can only see in France.

Inspired by [OnlyInPortugal.com](https://onlyinportugal.com) and made in a few hours thanks to:

- 🌍 [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com) – for the domain
- ☁️ [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) – for DNS + SSL
- 💾 [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) – for free hosting
- 💬 [Featurebase](https://featurebase.app) – for the interactive public board

## 🚀 How It Works

- Visitors submit posts to a Featurebase board
- Others can upvote and comment
- Everything is embedded directly in a static HTML page
- No backend, no server, no database management

## 🛠 Setup Instructions

1. Buy a domain like `onlyinfrance.com` on [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com)
2. Set up DNS via [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)
3. Fork this repo or clone it
4. Replace the iframe URL in `index.html` with your own Featurebase board link
5. Push changes to `main` branch
6. Enable GitHub Pages in the repo settings
7. Connect your domain to GitHub Pages via Cloudflare
8. Done! 🎉
